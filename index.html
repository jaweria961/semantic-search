            Carlton Town Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in Gedling, 
            Nottinghamshire, England. Founded in 1904 as Sneinton Football Club, it was described 
            in 1909 as "the leading amateur football club in Nottingham". Its reputation declined 
            thereafter, with the team participating in obscure county divisions until the 1995â€“96 season saw the club join the nationwide league system. Carlton competes in the Northern Premier League's Division One East in the eighth tier of the English football pyramid. Its home base since the early 1990s has been the Bill Stokeld Stadium (entrance pictured).
